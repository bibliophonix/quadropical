# Quadropical

Quadrant graphing and topic modeling, sort of [1].

Run a topic modeling algorithm over a set of text data in a CSV file. Choose a variable number of topics and then graph those topics as radial regions in a scatterplot.

After uploading a CSV file that serves as your document corpus, you can interact with the model by customizing the stop words list and create synonym rings to combine multiple terms into a single concept. The modeling algorithm can be re-run multiple times.

[1] While the project is named for quadrant graphing, it now enables a variable number of topics between 3 and 10 to be used.

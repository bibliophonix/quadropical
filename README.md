Quantile graphing and topic modeling.

Run a topic modeling algorithm over a set of text data in a CSV file. Choose a variable number of topics and then graph those topics as radial quantile regions in a scatterplot-like graph.

After uploading a CSV file that serves as your document corpus, you can interact with the model by customizing the stop words list and create synonym rings to combine multiple terms into a single concept. The modeling algorithm can be re-run multiple times.
